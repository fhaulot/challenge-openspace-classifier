## Description

The project is about randomly assign seats to a classroom and switch them everyday, this way classmates from Bouman9 will get to know each others!

Run the main.py to have new places for the class everyday!

## Usage

Let's see wath the code in main.py do
 1. We extract names in "utils\__pycache__\openspace.cpython-313.pyc"
 2. The "openspace.py" will see how many seats and tables are available in "table.py" 
 3. The "table.py" will return if seats are empty or full.
